💻 I'm a Software Engineer with a focus on backend development.

🚀 I love astronomy and in my spare time I keep up to date with the latest discovery expecially about black holes and neutron stars.

🎸 I also love to play my two electric left-handed (😎) guitars: Ibanez RG550L, Gibson Les Paul Studio

🎮 In my spare time I also love to play music, play soccer with friends and play videogames.
